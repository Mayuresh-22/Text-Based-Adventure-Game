# Text-Based Adventure Game

This is a text-based adventure game developed in Java where the user can interact with the game components and move with the help of predefined commands.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from [Java's official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

Once you have Java installed, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/Text-Based-Adventure-Game.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to compile the game:

```
javac TextAdventureGame.java
```

Then, run the following command to start the game:

```
java TextAdventureGame
```

## How to Play

The game is played entirely through the command line interface. When you start the game, you will be presented with a prompt where you can enter commands to interact with the game. (We suggest you to run above game files in any modern IDE's eg Visual Studios, intellij etc)

The following commands are available:

- `<direction>`: Moves the player in the specified direction (N - north, S- south, E - east, or W - west).
- `look`: Displays a description of the current room.
- `inventory`: Displays the player's current inventory.
- `take <item>`: Adds the specified item to the player's inventory.
- `use <item>`: Uses the specified item in the current room.
- `help`: Displays a list of available commands.

The goal of the game is to navigate through different rooms, collect items, and solve puzzles to ultimately reach the final room and complete the game.
